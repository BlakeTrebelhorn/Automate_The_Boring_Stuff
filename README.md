# Automate_The_Boring_Stuff
My code while going through the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.

So I quickly got bored with the Part 1 section, as I already know a lot of Python and programming structures. 
I cherry picked what I thought I needed to work on after the swordfish excercise, as I wanted to quickly get 
  to the more advanced ideas.
